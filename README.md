angular-responsive-nav
======================

A simple, responsive horizontal nav bar that will collapse options into a "More" dropdown as the screen gets smaller.

If you are already using <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap">angular-ui</a>/<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">twitter bootstrap css</a>, you can delete the commented code. Otherwise, uncomment the portions taken from each as they are noted, since having the full angular-ui/twitter bootstrap css seems overkill if you're not already using it. (They both are cool though)

Still working on getting the files up... Check back soon!!
